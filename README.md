## All India Directory
All India Directory is an Android app available in play store. You can [download it from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.techbeat.AllIndiaDirectory)
The app lets you search for any mobile/landline number in India and returns you the name of its owner. Unlike Truecaller, it does not upload your full contacts list onto any server.
It uses a pre-owned database for its searches. It aggressively uses local caching so lookups are very fast.
